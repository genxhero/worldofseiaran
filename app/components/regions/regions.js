        overview: "A heavily settled region surrounding a bay (or a sea depending on whom you ask)roughly the shape of a crescent moon.  Legend has it that the Dragon Empress used her significant power to flood the lands surrounding her castle in order to create the ultimate moat full of horrors from the depths.  Over the centuries the number of monsters in the bay has decreased, but will most likely never be depleted.",
